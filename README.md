# Wonder-Reader

TODO:
* On load, the app opens up into the __library__, which functions as the main window for the entire app. If lib is closed, entire app closes.
	* __library__ will display __frontPages__ of each issue/book.  There current exists a __.cbr__ module in node.  Look into coding __.cbz__, zip files, file system, and image display.
* Loading a file creates a __newWindow__, with navigation buttons "__naviBar__".  Maybe include some sort of skinning possibilities; TBD.
	* Comics at either __firstPage__ or __lastPage__ can open up the next file in library folder.
	* __naviBar__: __firstPage__, __prevPage__, __nextPage__, __lastPage__, __zoom__. Others will be included as soon as conceived.  
* Make sketch layouts.  
* Any other neat ideas that could work go here too.
